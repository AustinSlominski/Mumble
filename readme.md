# Mumble

Mumble is a space where artists can share and collaborate with others that they trust. I want artists to have tools to work on their projects, interact with their community, and reach out and connect with artists within other communities.

## Collectives

Artists on Mumble are organized into collectives. These are groups of artists that you trust, the people you are work with and share with. This helps make sure you feel comfortable sharing unfinished work, and it helps you ask for help and get responses from people you know can help you.

## Projects

Organize what you are working on and share what you want to with your collective. Finished projects can be visible to anyone, but 
unfinished projects will only be visible to others in your collective.

## Profiles

Describe what you do, showcase some of your favorite work. This is where you can set your availability and edit your skills.

## Bulletin

Here you can make posts alerting your collective to upcoming events, or let them know that you really need a trumpet player.
